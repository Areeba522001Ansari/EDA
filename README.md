Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Description:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data analysis that involves examining and visualizing data to uncover insights, patterns, and relationships. By applying statistical techniques and data visualization tools, EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and characteristics. It helps in identifying outliers, assessing data quality, and exploring correlations between variables. EDA plays a crucial role in feature selection, data preprocessing, and laying the groundwork for data-driven decision-making. With EDA, stakeholders can gain valuable insights from the data and make informed choices based on a solid understanding of the dataset.
